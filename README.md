# Stock-Market-Analysis-Dashboard
This project presents a fully interactive Stock Market Analysis Dashboard developed using Power BI, designed to simulate a real-world fintech analytics environment. The solution processes and analyzes multi-year historical equity data across multiple listed companies, covering hundreds of trading sessions per stock and thousands of daily price observations (Open, High, Low, Close). Through structured time-series modeling and dynamic DAX calculations, the dashboard transforms raw market data into measurable, decision-support intelligence.

The analytical framework incorporates 20-day and 50-day moving averages to evaluate short-term and long-term trend direction, enabling systematic detection of crossover events that signal potential market regime shifts. Daily return percentages are computed across the full dataset to measure price momentum, while a 20-day rolling standard deviation quantifies short-term volatility and risk exposure. These rolling-window calculations update dynamically for each selected symbol and date range, recalculating metrics across hundreds of observations in real time.

By applying this structured logic, the dashboard enables identification of trend reversals, momentum acceleration, volatility spikes during unstable periods, and divergence between short-term and long-term price behavior. Automated bullish and bearish signal classification provides rule-based interpretation of market direction, closely resembling simplified signal-generation logic used in trading analytics and portfolio monitoring systems.

Overall, the project demonstrates the practical application of quantitative financial modeling within a business intelligence environment. It showcases how fintech solutions can process large volumes of historical time-series data, apply statistical risk measures, and deliver interactive analytics that support portfolio evaluation, performance monitoring, and data-driven investment decision-making.
